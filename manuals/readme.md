<h2>Gothello</h2>
<p>The main differences are that Gothello has the first four checkers (figures) in the middle set as the opening and is played on a 10 x 10 grid; with two players 2 each and with 4 one each. In Gothello Variant II, two players each have exactly 32 stones (four players each have exactly 16), which corresponds to an 8x8 grid like in Chess. On a 10x10 grid with 4 players, 9 more checkers (figures) are added. Conventional variants with 2 Players can be played with two-sided QuantumToken (Jetons are black and white token). With 4 Players you use a so-called QuantumCube, but without conventional color divisions - different motifs (black) on a white background are completely sufficient. That's why Gothello is designed for up to 6 players; there is no longer a distinction between black and white, but different figures – single and double clubs, spades, shamrock, single and fourfold diamonds – or dots (1 to 6) for value are shown on a dice.With 4 Players, just one stone for each is placed in the middle as an opening (line-up). Alternatively, an additional stone is placed in each of the corners. The Go squares and connecting lines (their number and arrangement varies depending on the size of the grid), where no hitting is allowed, become of particular interest. In all variants, in addition to the square fields (Variant 1: Othello mode), the connecting lines (variant 3: Go mode) can also be included. In Gothello you can turn around (Variant 2: reverse mode, opening game), block (caught), conquer form the middle game, push (jump) in variant 4 (checker mode, endgame). </p>
