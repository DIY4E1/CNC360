# The QuantumGrid and the PlaybookAI
A novel substitute for the gaming experience by using multi-player tokens (Quantum Tokens, Quantum Cubes) and multi-layer grids (for Checkmates, Checkmaster,  Checkathon, Checkorrerey or Chess Docker and Gothello). The Playbook not only thinks of conventional notations of strokes and line-ups, but also uses simple notations in the form of coordinates XZ (2D vectors) and XYZ (3D vectors) as well as longitude and latitude (X-axis:= west 180° – 0° – east 180°, Z-axis:= north 180° – 0° – south 180°) and height and depth meters (altitude, Y-axis). This allows a notation on a wider QuantumGrid (2048px = 541.87 mm). From now on, much more Players and Figures moves along connecting lines – the moves are no longer limited to squared fields. The multi-sided tokens (Qt, Qb) allow game skills to be inherited, devalued and upgraded. This also allows the compatibility of a wide variety of board games (Chess, Checkers, Mill, Othello and Go etc.). New game skills (missions: occupy, piggyback, capture, overrun) and characters are added (Squires, Sagittarius, Pegasus, Captains, Castles, Unicorns, Knights with helm, Knights on horses, Djinns, Chinese Dragons, Emperors, (Pretender to the) Thrones, Barques, Brigantines and so on). The notation ranges from number 1 to 20 and from c0 to f2. The Player´s mission requires a 3D notation. The Multi-Player variants require a notation with degrees. The restrictions allow the moves to be compared with one another and with each other then to build a 'never seen before' Artificial Intelligence (PlaybookAI).
<h3>Big bang for the buck</h3>
<hr>
<p>The QuantumGrid (2048px) below integrates all mathematical notations and relevant marks (Go, Mill, Chess Docker). If we follow this, we can accommodate several players on one game board. By following specific manuals, we can even combine the most different Board Games with one another (Othello mixed with Checkers, Chess versus Checkers and so on).</p>

<h3>Massively multilayer role-playing experiences</h3>
<hr>
<p>Conventional Chess notation is algebraic but not mathematically correct. So I've developed compliant rules for The PlaybookAI, which we'll explore in more depth. First, I want to explain the more understandable specifications. The playbook is easy to use, you note down moves, analyze the opponent's game during a training phase - which nobody talks about and is silent about - in order to then be able to use these moves in the current season/tournament; similar to the playbook in American Football.<br>For other board games, there are no notation rules at all, only text-based instructions, which are also very complex - with the consequence that one leaves it with the simpler rules or general types of play, which I think is a shame.</p>
<h3>Quantum Leaps have started</h3>
<hr>
<p>Now we deal with which character (glyph) can be combined with other characters (glyphs), transformed and how it can be defeated; this applies to the starting line-up, the handicap game, the middle game and the endgame. From now on we are using QuantumCubes instead of multiple figures.</p>
