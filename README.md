# The QuantumGrid and the Playbook
A novel substitute for the gaming experience by using multi-player tokens (Quantum Tokens, Quantum Cubes) and multi-layer grids (for Checkmates, Checkothello, Checkathon, Checkorrerey). The Playbook not only thinks of conventional notations of strokes and line-ups, but also uses simple notations in the form of coordinates (2D) as well as longitude and latitude and height and depth meters (3D). This allows a notation on a wider QuantumGrid. From now on, much more Players and Figures moves along connecting lines â€“ the moves are no longer limited to squared fields. The multi-sided tokens (Qt, Qb) allow game skills to be inherited, devalued and upgraded. This also allows the compatibility of a wide variety of board games (Chess, Checkers, Mill, Othello and Go etc.). New game skills (missions: piggyback, capture, overrun) and characters are added (Squires, Captains, Dragons, Thrones and so on).
