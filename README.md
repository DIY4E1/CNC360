# From the QuantumGrid to the PlaybookAI
A novel substitute for the gaming experience by using multi-player tokens (Quantum Tokens, Quantum Cubes) and multi-layer grids (for Checkmates, Checkmaster,  Checkathon, Checkorrerey or Chess Docker and Gothello). The Playbook not only thinks of conventional notations of strokes and line-ups, but also uses simple notations in the form of coordinates XZ (2D vectors) and XYZ (3D vectors) as well as longitude and latitude (X-axis:= west 180° – 0° – east 180°, Z-axis:= north 90° – 0° – south 90°) and height and depth meters (altitude, Y-axis). This allows a notation on a wider QuantumGrid (2048px = 541.87 mm). From now on, much more Players and Figures moves along connecting lines – the moves are no longer limited to squared fields. The multi-sided tokens/tiles (Qubes, Quards) allow game skills to be inherited, devalued and upgraded. This also allows the compatibility of a wide variety of board games (Chess, Checkers, Mill, Othello and Go etc.). New game skills (missions: occupy, piggyback, capture, overrun, promote, penalty etc.) and characters are added (Squires, Sagittarius, Pegasus, Captains, Castles, Unicorns, Knights with helm, Knights on horses, Djinns, Chinese Dragons, Emperors, (Pretender to the) Thrones, Barques, Brigantines, Units and so on). The notation ranges from number 1 to 20 and from c0 to f2. The Player´s mission requires a 3D notation. The Multi-Player variants require a notation with degrees. The restrictions allow the moves to be compared with one another and with each other then to build a 'never seen before' Artificial Intelligence (PlaybookAI).
<h3>Big bang for the buck</h3>

<p>The QuantumGrid (2048px x 2048px, 541.867 mm x 541.867 mm) below integrates all mathematical notations and relevant marks (Go, Mill, Checkers, Chess-4-Player, Chess Docker). If we follow this, we can accommodate several players on one game board. By following specific manuals, we can even combine the most different Board Games with one another (Othello mixed with Checkers, Chess versus Checkers and so on). </p>

The 1st QuantumGrid above shows a full grid for Checkmaster where all Docker marks integrated. The 2nd QuantumGrid shows the largest QuantumGrid for Gothello. The 3rd QuantumGrid shows vector notation (x, y, z) for Chess Dockers (or Qube Chess) based on longitude, latitude and altitude. The 4th QuantumGrid allows line-up for up to four Players with squared fields (Chess, Checkers).

<h3>The unprecedented and 'interactive' QuantumGrid without a Computer User Interface</h3>
The 5th QuantumGrid (8 x 8 or 9 x 9) below is called Passthrough for Chess and maybe Checkers, too. The placeholders are occupied by Memory Cards printed on both sides. If such fields are passed, then they are converted or reversed. The playing field changes as the game progresses. Character development is left to chance. A standard field can be passed in all directions and occupied in the middle, but only in one, two or three directions (mono, bisecting, trisecting) after the conversion. If a converted field is passed again, the rules can state whether it should rotate in 90° or be flipped once again. The diameter of a figure's footprint determines whether half, full or even quarter steps can be taken. Playing on a 9 x 9 grid results in a novel setup with three towers and three dragons (Dungeon & Dragon) or three dragons and a throne (Game of Thrones) and others (e.g. Battle Ship, Master and Commander). The two player mode ends after two checkmates, one of the king and another of the throne. Three of a kind in a harmonious row leads to the capture of the intervening pieces until the trap is released or one of the three pieces is defeated (similar to the Nine Men's Mills game. <div>

</div>For the Memory Cards you need QuantumSquares (Quards) in the same number and format (possibly 64 to 81 or more) for the front, but with different motifs for the back (24 to 32 or more). However, the frequency distribution can still vary, because you determine the size of the grid yourself with the help of Memory Quards (cards) and the cards are shuffled beforehand, so you never know exactly how many cards from the stack make up the grid or which motifs are on the back will be located. But you can also use a double-sided printed playing card of 32 or higher, which is easier to shuffle, in this case you place 8 cards horizontally (a<sub>1</sub> to h<sub>1</sub>) and 4 cards vertically (1 to 8). The cards can be turned over more flexibly: passing horizontally leads to turning over, vertical converting only when both fields have been passed. If a field is occupied while passing, the field remains untouched. Instead of a square field, you can also put together a rectangular field. Rules can state that a QuantumSquare from the starting formation (line up) is dragged along with the figure, so that the shape of the playing field also changes. Instead of placing (moving) a figure, the player can draw a new QuantumSquare from a stack or bag to cover up awkward paths instead of having to pass through a QuantumSquare first to convert it.

<p>Massively multilayer role-playing experiences: Conventional Chess notation is algebraic but not mathematically correct. So I've developed compliant rules for The PlaybookAI, which we'll explore in more depth. First, I want to explain the more understandable specifications. The playbook is easy to use, you note down moves, analyze the opponent's game during a training phase - which nobody talks about and is silent about - in order to then be able to use these moves in the current season/tournament; similar to the playbook in American Football.<br>For other board games, there are no notation rules at all, only text-based instructions, which are also very complex - with the consequence that one leaves it with the simpler rules or general types of play, which I think is a shame.</p>
<p>Quantum Leaps have started: Now we deal with which character (glyph) can be combined with other characters (glyphs), transformed and how it can be defeated; this applies to the starting line-up, the play by default (handicap game), the middle game and the endgame. From now on we are using Qubes instead of multiple figures and a flexible QuantumGrid instead of a conventional Game Boards.</p>
